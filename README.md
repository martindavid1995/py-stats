## Python programs to compute statistics that are too annoying to do by hand

### Utilities
**summaryStatistics.py**
> **This file must be present in order for the below programs to function** 
> Performs the following statistical computations:
> * Sum of Squares
> * Sxy, Sxx, Sxy
> * b1, b2
> * SEE
> * Variance
> * Coefficient of Determination

### Programs
**fStatistic.py**
> Performs multiple comparisons procedure for identifying a difference in means by computing an f-statistic. Generates an accurate ANOVA table. Determines which pairs of data have significant differences by calculating W range. Works for groups of constant or varying lengths. 

**leastSquares.py**
> Computes the following linear regression model parameters:
> * Least-squares line of best fit
> * Variance
> * Standard deviation
> * Coefficient determination
> 
> Provides an option to plot data in order to help assess linear trends.

**regressionTests.py**
> Calculates confidence intervals and performs hypothesis tests of regression tests. Computes ANOVA f-statistic, coefficient of determination, and standard deviations. 

**predictYValues.py**
> Calculates confidence intervals, prediction intervals, performs hypothesis tests, and determines regression equations for making inferences about statistical means.
